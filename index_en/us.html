                        Since creating toy boxes for our own use in 2014, we have grown
                        before the commercial production of children's furniture for storing toys and not only.<br><br>
                        The main idea when opening the workshop was to create a high-quality, convenient and environmentally friendly
                        clean furniture. We found that buy normal, children's toy furniture made
                        not made of plastic or chipboard, potchi impossible. Then we had the idea of creating our own
                        workshop's. We decided that we will not save on materials and coatings, while sacrificing
                        quality and safety. That's why, toy boxes, shelving, shelves, and pencil cases,
                        hand-made by our craftsmen from eco-friendly birch plywood (class E1),
                        painted with a highly ecological water-based wax varnish.
